# lrcd.tcl v-1.0.5:
#
# Tcl script for VMD to calculate the Ligand-Receptor Contact Distance (LRCD)
# parameter that compares the interaction profile of two complexes involving
# small molecules as the ligands and macromolecules as the receptors.
#
# Several variants of the LRCD parameter are implemented:
#  LRCD   - Ligand-Receptor Contact Distance.
#  LRCND  - Ligand-Receptor Contact Normalized Distance.
#  LRCDI  - Ligand-Receptor Contact Distance Index [= 1/(1 + LRCND)].
#  LRCMD  - Ligand-Receptor Contact Manhattan Distance.
#  LRCMDI - Ligand-Receptor Contact Manhattan Distance Index [= 1/(1 + LRCMD)].
#  LRCP   - Ligand-Receptor Contact Projection.
# 
# Reference: ...
#
# This script should be sourced within the program VMD either in the TkConsole,
# in the VMD's command line or from a .vmdrc file:
#
# i.e.
# # from the VMD's TkConsole:
# source lrcd.tcl
# # from the command line:
# vmd -e lrcd.tcl
#
# Instructions:
#
#   -This library was created to be used within the TkConsole of VMD, with
#    the molecules forming ligand-receptor complexes already loaded. The
#    ligand and receptor moieties of a complex may either be part of the
#    same molecule or come from different molecules, i.e., they may be
#    provided as separated files.
#
#   -This library requires prior definition by the user of the atom selections
#    specifying at least two complexes (A and B), each involving a ligand
#    (ligA and ligB) and a receptor (recA and recB) moieties. Each of this
#    four atom selections have to specify also the Id assigned by VMD when the
#    molecule containing the atom selections was loaded.
#
#   -The atom selections and Ids are stored in a Tcl array called selInfo.
#    The array keys follow the format: selInfo(<UserLabel>,<Keyword>).
#    The user specifies a label to identify a complex (<UserLabel>) and,
#    separated by a comma, one of the following keywords: 'ligId', 'ligSelTxt',
#    'recId', 'recSelTxt', and 'title'. Some examples below:
#      set selInfo(MyComplex,ligId) 0
#      set selInfo(MyComplex,ligSelTxt) "noh"
#      set selInfo(MyComplex,recId) 1
#      set selInfo(MyComplex,recSelTxt) "protein and chain A and noh"
#      set selInfo(MyComplex,title) "First lig-rec complex declared"
#
#   -Note that the ligId and recId correspond to the Ids in VMD of already
#    loaded molecules. ligSelTxt and recSelTxt are text (enclosed by "")
#    in VMD's atom selection language. See Selection Methods in the VMD
#    user's guide.
#
#   -Once declared two or more complexes in the selInfo array, the procedures
#    lrcdMat_dct, lrcdMat_cmd, and lrcdMat_lapa may be used in sequence to
#    calculate the lrcd matrix that stores lig-rec interaction measurements.
#    Then the lrcdVec_sum procedure is used to calculate the lrcd vectors
#    for each complex with sums over each interaction type. Finally, the
#    lrcd procedure uses two lrcd vectors to calculate the LRCD parameter.
#    See lrcd_test1 procedure below for an example on these steps.
#
#   -Alternatively, the procedures lrcd_pwMat and lrcd_dlgTab perform the
#    whole sequence of steps to calculate the LRCD parameter for several
#    complexes. These procedures also show the usage of lower-level procedures.
#    The lrcd_pwMat procedure calculate all pairs in a set of complexes
#    declared in the selInfo array, and specified by a list of <UserLabel>
#    identifiers. See lrcd_test2 below for an usage example. The lrcd_dlgTab
#    procedure calculate the LRCD parameter for all the complexes in a .dlg
#    file obtained from an AutoDock (version 3 or 4) molecular docking
#    calculation. In this case, the .dlg file is loaded into VMD specifying
#    PDB format. The best binding poses from the cluster analysis performed
#    by AutoDock are loaded as frames in a single molecule. Thus, the
#    procedure runs over these frames and calculate the LRCD against a
#    common reference complex. Obviously, all poses consider the same receptor.
#    See lrcd_test3 procedure below for an usage example. Several .dlg files
#    may be processed with the proper set up of the selInfo array.
#
#   -Note that the lrcd_dlgTab does not actually use any information from the
#    .dlg file, but rather only the poses of a ligand taken from a .dlg file
#    are loaded into VMD as a PDB file with several frames. Thus, the procedure
#    is independent from the docking program used to generate the complexes 
#    whenever the resulting poses may be loaded into VMD in a single molecule.
#
#   -The procedures lrcd_test* provide examples of different ways of performing
#    the LRCD calculation:
#      -lrcd_test1: performs the whole calculation for a single
#       pair of complexes taken from two PDB structures.
#      -lrcd_test2: calculates a pairwise matrix of LRCD for a set of 16
#       COX-1/2 - ligand complexes, downloading the files
#       from the repository using the internet.
#      -lrcd_test3: calculate the LRCD for the best binding poses obtained
#       from a .dlg AutoDock molecular docking calculation taken the lowest-
#       energy pose as reference for the rest.
#      -lrcd_test4: calculate the LRCD for a list of complexes or a list
#       of docking poses (.dlg file) taking as reference LRC vectors
#       pre-calculated for a set of PDB complexes (as a data base).
#
#   -In order to run the test procedures it may be neccessary to change to
#    the directory containing the lrcd.tcl script and the subdirectories
#    test1, ..., test4 with the 'cd' command in the TkConsole of VMD.
